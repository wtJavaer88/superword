<p> Nathan Redmond's first-half finish gave <a data-action="southampton-fc" data-content-type="section-topic" data-track="false" data-type="inline" data-word-count="1" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> the upper-hand heading into their EFL Cup semi-final second leg. </p><p> Jurgen Klopp's <a data-action="liverpool-fc" data-content-type="section-topic" data-track="false" data-type="inline" data-word-count="1" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> side must now win at Anfield if they are to book their place at <a data-action="wembley" data-content-type="section-topic" data-track="false" data-type="inline" data-word-count="1" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wembley">Wembley</a> and avenge last year's final defeat in his quest for silverware. </p><p> But Claude Puel's men proved they are no pushovers with <a data-action="nathan-redmond" data-content-type="section-topic" data-track="false" data-type="inline" data-word-count="1" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nathan-redmond">Redmond's</a> 20th minute strike giving them a slender lead in the tie. </p><p>Mirror Football's John Cross was at St Mary's to rate the players' performances...</p><h3>SOUTHAMPTON</h3><p> Forster 7 <br /> Terrific early save, looks as if he could improve communication with his defence. </p><p> Cedric 7 <br /> Good forward runs, his overlaps often helped Southampton mount attacks. </p><p> Yoshida 6 <br /> If Yoshida is the replacement, then Saints need to make peace with Fonte. </p><p> Van Dijk 8 <br /> <strong>MotM.</strong> Much better than in recent weeks, was focused again. Was a rock. </p><p> Bertrand 7 <br /> Good forward runs caused Liverpool¡¯s defence major problems. </p><p> Clasie 7 <br /> Nice combinations with Davis. Looked good in Southampton¡¯s midfield. </p><p> Davis 7 <br /> Terrific energetic midfield display. Covered ground and made terrific passes. </p><p> Romeu 7 <br /> Very consistent performer, so reliable for Saints. Often under appreciated player. </p><p> Redmond 7 <br /> Cool finish for Southampton¡¯s opener, could have scored again, great prospect. </p><p> Tadic 7 <br /> Nice clever touches, looks a class act and worked hard to match his skill. </p><p> Rodriguez 7 <br /> Claimed Saints can cope with the regular talent drain. And backed up his argument. </p><p> <strong>Substitutes:</strong> </p><p> Holjberg (Clasie, 74) <br /> Long (Rodriguez, 82), <br /> Ward-Prowse (Davis, 82) </p><h3>LIVERPOOL</h3><p> Karius 7 <br /> Made brilliant saves to keep the tie alive, denying both Redmond and Bertrand. </p><p> Clyne 6 <br /> Did his most important work in defence and Liverpool missed his forward runs. </p><p> Lovren 5 <br /> Got more stick than the other former Southampton players - and it affected him. </p><p> Klavan 5 <br /> Made a mistake in the build-up to Southampton¡¯s opener. </p><p> Milner 6 <br /> Does such a reliable steady job for the team, limited opportunities going forward. </p><p> Lucas 6 <br /> Still does a solid job despite those doubts if he will leave in January. </p><p> Can 6 <br /> Good physical strength but lacked quality to find the killer through ball. </p><p> Wijnaldum 5 <br /> Lots of energy but looked rather lost on left of midfield three. </p><p> Lallana 6 <br /> Got jeered on his return to St Mary¡¯s, not at his best on the right. </p><p> Firmino 6 <br /> Lively start but was denied by terrific early save from Forster. Faded. </p><p> Sturridge 6 <br /> Some flashy touches but lack of end product brought familiar frustrations. </p><p> <strong>Substitutes</strong> <br /> Coutinho (Wijnaldum, 61 mins) 6 <br /> Origi (Firmino, 83) </p>
